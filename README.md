Android application concept.

- *NOTE*:
    This application is full of "hacky" code. It currently doesn't work as intended, but it should prove to be a good perspective on the "Do's and "Dont's" of Android development.
* Core project Java files can be found in: Clockoodle/Clockoodle/app/src/main/java/com/example/clockoodle/
